Here's a detailed explanation of the code in sentences, step by step:

Importing Scanner Class:

- The code starts by importing the java.util.Scanner class, which is used to get input from the user.

Class and Main Method:

- The CurrencyConverter class is defined, and the main method is the entry point of the program.
- The main method is where the program starts execution.

Displaying Menu and Getting User Input:

- The program displays a menu with three currency options: Rupee, Dollar, and Euro.
- The user is prompted to choose a currency by entering a number (1 for Rupee, 2 for Dollar, or 3 for Euro).

- The user is then prompted to enter an amount, which is stored in the amount variable using sc.nextDouble().

Converting Currency:

- Based on the user's choice, the program calls a specific method to perform the currency conversion:
    - If the user chooses Rupee (option 1), the Ruppe_to_other method is called.
    - If the user chooses Dollar (option 2), the Dollar_to_other method is called.
    - If the user chooses Euro (option 3), the Euro_to_other method is called.
- If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an "Invalid choice" message.

Ruppe_to_other Method

- This method takes the amount in Rupees as input and converts it to Dollars and Euros.
- It displays the conversion rates for 1 Rupee to Dollar and Euro.
- It then calculates and displays the equivalent amount in Dollars and Euros for the given amount in Rupees.

Dollar_to_other Method

- This method takes the amount in Dollars as input and converts it to Rupees and Euros.
- It displays the conversion rates for 1 Dollar to Rupee and Euro.
- It then calculates and displays the equivalent amount in Rupees and Euros for the given amount in Dollars.

Euro_to_other Method

- This method takes the amount in Euros as input and converts it to Rupees and Dollars.
- It displays the conversion rates for 1 Euro to Rupee and Dollar.
- It then calculates and displays the equivalent amount in Rupees and Dollars for the given amount in Euros.

Program Execution:

- The program executes the chosen method and displays the conversion results.
- The Scanner object is used to get input from the user, and the program uses System.out.println statements to display the results.

Overall, this program provides a simple currency conversion tool that allows users to convert between Rupees, Dollars, and Euros.
